Our team is collecting data on a variety of topics, specifically on the scale of 'county.' 

I plan on using data from the American Community Survey, tables DP02, DP03, S1501, and G001 most recent 5 year survey available.

My target will be whether the median income of the county is high-income, middle-income, or low-income.  Features I intend to use include the following:
	Demographics - age, racial composition
	Migrant status - native, immigrant, citizenship status
	Moved recently?
	Household size & composition
	Industry distribution
	Gini coefficient within the county
	Number of accredited post-secondary schools
	Population density
	Health insurance penetration
	Possibly others tbd

I plan to try as many of the classification algorithms as I can..  :)
